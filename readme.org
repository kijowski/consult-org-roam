This is a collection of functions to operate [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]] with the help of
[[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]] and its live preview feature. You can use it to search, filter
and find notes, preview backlinks as well as forward links, and sift
through currently open org-roam buffers.

* Overview and usage

** =consult-org-roam.el=
=consult-org-roam.el= provides several functions to connect [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]]
to [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]]'s completing read interface. On the one hand, it provides
the following standalone functions which enhance =org-roam='s
capabilities:

- =consult-org-roam-file-find= :: Search your org-roam files with
  consult's completing-read and its live preview
- =consult-org-roam-backlinks= :: List backlinks to
  =org-roam-node-at-point= (e.g. currently open note) and sift through
  them with consult's completing-read and its live preview
- =consult-org-roam-forward-links= :: List forward links contained in
  the currently opened note
- =consult-org-roam-search= :: [[https://github.com/minad/consult#asynchronous-search][Asynchronously search]] your
  roam-directory with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html][grep]] or [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]]

On the other hand, it provides a minormode called
=consult-org-roam-mode=. When activated, =org-roam-node-read= is
overridden, which is used by =org-roam-node-find=,
=org-roam-node-insert= and =org-roam-refile=. By doing so, all
functions utilizing completing-read resort to =consult= for performing
completion. Furthermore, the same is done for =org-roam-ref-read= so
that =consult= is used for completing references as well.

Eventually, you might want to suppress previewing for certain
functions. This can be done by adding using
=consult-customize=.

** =consult-org-roam-buffer.el=
=consult-org-roam-buffer.el= adds a new source to =consult-buffer= for
narrowing the selection to the currently open org-roam buffers. The
predefined narrow-key is =n= (for notes) but could be conveniently
customized via =consult-org-roam-buffer-narrow-key=. You can also disable
automatic setup by setting =consult-org-roam-buffer-auto-setup=
to =nil= - in that case you need to add =org-roam-buffer-source= yourself.

* Installation
You can install it from Melpa. If you are using =use-package=, the following
snippet might serve as a viable starting point:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package consult-org-roam
   :ensure t
   :after org-roam
   :init
   (require 'consult-org-roam)
   ;; Activate the minor mode
   (consult-org-roam-mode 1)
   :custom
   ;; Use `ripgrep' for searching with `consult-org-roam-search'
   (consult-org-roam-grep-func #'consult-ripgrep)
   ;; Configure a custom narrow key for `consult-buffer'
   (consult-org-roam-buffer-narrow-key ?r)
   ;; Display org-roam buffers right after non-org-roam buffers
   ;; in consult-buffer (and not down at the bottom)
   (consult-org-roam-buffer-after-buffers t)
   ;; Enable automatic setup
   (consult-org-roam-buffer-auto-setup t)
   :config
   ;; Eventually suppress previewing for certain functions
   (consult-customize
    consult-org-roam-forward-links
    :preview-key (kbd "M-."))
   :bind
   ;; Define some convenient keybindings as an addition
   ("C-c n e" . consult-org-roam-file-find)
   ("C-c n b" . consult-org-roam-backlinks)
   ("C-c n l" . consult-org-roam-forward-links)
   ("C-c n r" . consult-org-roam-search))
#+end_src

* Dependencies
=consult-org-roam= is built on top of [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]] and [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]], it relies
on its functionality.

Furthermore, ensure that you have at least [[https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html][grep]] or [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]] installed
on your system, and set =consult-org-roam-grep-func= to
=#'consult-ripgrep= when using the latter.
